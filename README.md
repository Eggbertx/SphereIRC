SphereIRC
=======
An IRC client (and maybe eventually server) module for the miniSphere game engine  
Unlike my old IRC project using the old Sphere engine, [SphereBot](https://github.com/Eggbertx/SphereBot-legacy), this is going to be a general purpose IRC module that can be integrated into your online miniSphere game projects. As I update SphereIRC, I'll add more examples and useful information to `src/main.js` for reference.

Basic Usage
------
Assuming you already have miniSphere installed (and if you don't, see the second link), copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and modify it to your liking and needs.  
Then run `cell && spherun dist`.
